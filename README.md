# Submission Reminder App Setup

## Overview
The `create_environment.sh` script automates the setup of a directory structure for the **Submission Reminder App**. It prompts the user for their name and uses it to create a personalized project directory named `submission_reminder_{yourName}`. The script then generates essential subdirectories and files required for the application.

## Features
- Prompts user for their name
- Creates a structured environment for the application
- Generates necessary subdirectories and files

## Directory Structure
After running the script, the following directory structure will be created:
```
submission_reminder_{yourName}/
│
├── app/
│   ├── reminder.sh
│
├── modules/
│   ├── functions.sh
│
├── assets/
│   ├── submissions.txt
│
├── config/
│   ├── config.env
│
├── startup.sh (to be created manually)
```

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)
```sh
# Clone the repository
# git clone <repository_url>
# cd into the project directory
cd <repository_folder>
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable
Ensure the script has execution permissions:
```sh
chmod +x create_environment.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script
Execute the script to set up the project:
```sh
./create_environment.sh
```

### 4. Provide Your Name
The script will prompt:
```
Enter your name:
```
Enter your name, and the project folder will be created accordingly.

### 5. Verify the Created Environment
Check if the directory and necessary files have been created:
```sh
ls -R submission_reminder_{yourName}
```

### 6. Run the Application
Once the setup is complete, manually create `startup.sh`, then execute:
```sh
./submission_reminder_{yourName}/startup.sh
```

## Script Explanation
- **Prompts the user** for their name
- **Creates the project directory** using the input name
- **Generates subdirectories**: `app`, `modules`, `assets`, `config`
- **Creates files**: `reminder.sh`, `functions.sh`, `submissions.txt`, `config.env`
- **Provides a ready-to-use structure** for the submission reminder app

## Notes
- Ensure you have execution permissions for `startup.sh` before running:
```sh
chmod +x submission_reminder_{yourName}/startup.sh
```
- `startup.sh` should be implemented separately to launch the application.
